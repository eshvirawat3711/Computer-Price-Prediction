# Computer-Price-Prediction
Creating a machine learning model which can predict the price of a computer based on its specifications like the Hard Drive, RAM, screen size etc.


The flow of the case study is as below:

* Reading the data in python
* Defining the problem statement
* Identifying the Target variable
* Looking at the distribution of Target variable
* Basic Data exploration
* Rejecting useless columns
* Visual Exploratory Data Analysis for data distribution (Histogram and Barcharts)
* Feature Selection based on data distribution
* Outlier treatment
* Missing Values treatment
* Visual correlation analysis
* Statistical correlation analysis (Feature Selection)
* Converting data to numeric for ML
* Sampling and K-fold cross validation
* Trying multiple Regression algorithms
* Selecting the best Model
* Deploying the best model in production

The data has one file "ComputerPricesData.csv". This file contains 6259 computers data.
